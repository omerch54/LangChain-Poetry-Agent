# **Multi-Agent Joke System**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a **multi-agent system** featuring two AI agents: a **stand-up comedian** and a **critic**. The comedian tells three jokes, one per turn, and the critic evaluates each joke on a scale of 1 to 4, where **1 means "poor joke"** and **4 means "excellent joke"**. 

The system leverages **LangChain** and **OpenAIâ€™s GPT model** to facilitate the interaction between the agents.

---

## **Scope**
- Create an AI-based stand-up comedian that generates jokes dynamically.
- Develop an AI-based critic to evaluate the jokes.
- Ensure the comedian tells exactly three jokes.
- Ensure the critic provides ratings for each joke.
- Present results in a **Jupyter Notebook** format with outputs displayed.

---

## **Value and Motivation**
Humor is a complex and subjective aspect of human communication. This project explores:
- **Artificial creativity**: How AI can generate humor.
- **Automated feedback systems**: How AI can critique creative outputs.
- **Multi-agent interaction**: How multiple AI agents can collaborate to perform structured tasks.

Beyond this assignment, the project has potential applications in:
- Entertainment chatbots.
- AI-powered joke generators.
- AI-based content evaluation.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the system.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building AI-powered applications.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for generating jokes and evaluating them.
- **NLTK**: For text processing and tokenization.

---

## **Installation and Setup**
### **1. Install Dependencies**
Run the following commands inside a Jupyter Notebook:
```python
!pip install -qU langchain-openai
!pip install nltk
```

### **2. Set Up OpenAI API Key**
Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI and store it securely:
```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key"
```

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the notebook to initialize the agents.
2. The comedian agent will generate and display three jokes.
3. The critic agent will evaluate and rate each joke.
4. The final results, including the joke and corresponding rating, will be displayed.

---

## **Expected Output**
The notebook will display:
- Three jokes generated by the comedian.
- Ratings provided by the critic for each joke.
- The final evaluation of all jokes.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Allow users to provide custom joke prompts.
- Implement more sophisticated joke evaluation (e.g., sentiment analysis, audience feedback).
- Introduce multiple critics with different humor preferences.
